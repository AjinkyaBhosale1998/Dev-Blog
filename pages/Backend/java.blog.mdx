## Java

Java is an open-source, class-based, high-level, object-oriented programming language. It is platform-independent as Java programs are compiled into byte code that is platform-independent.

## History

Java programming language was created by James Gosling in 1995. The original idea was to design a language for the television industry. Gosling worked along with his team, also called the Green Team, and the project they worked on was called Greentalk. This project was later named OAK, rooted in the oak tree that stood outside Goslingâ€™s office. However, the name had to be dropped later as it was already a trademark by Oak Technologies.

So how was the name Java suggested?

Since the language could no longer be named OAK, Gosling and his team had to come up with a new name. The team considered various names like DNA, RUBY, JAVA, jolt, dynamic, revolutionary, SILK. The name JAVA occurred to Gosling while having a cup of coffee at his office.

## Types of Java Applications

A. **Web Application:**
   Web applications run on web browsers using servlets, JSP, and struts technologies. These technologies create Java web applications and deploy them on servers.

B. **Mobile Application:**
   Mobile applications are created using Java.

C. **Standalone Application:**
   Standalone applications are executed independently without the need for other programs and files. An example of such an application is antivirus.

D. **Enterprise Application:**
   Some applications are designed for corporate organizations to control major processes in real time. These applications are called enterprise applications.

## Features

- **Object Oriented:**
  In object-oriented programming, everything is an object rather than function and logic.

- **Simple:**
  Java is simple to understand, easy to learn, and implement.

- **Secured:**
  It is possible to design secured software systems using Java.

- **Platform Independent:**
  Java is a write once and run anywhere language, meaning once the code is written, it can be executed on any software and hardware systems.

- **Portable:**
  Java is not necessarily fixated to a single hardware machine. Once created, Java code can be used on any platform.

- **Architecture Neutral:**
  Java is architecture neutral, meaning the size of primitive types is fixed and does not vary depending upon the type of architecture.

- **Robust:**
  Java emphasizes a lot on error handling, type checking, memory management, etc., making it a robust language.

- **Interpreted:**
  Java converts high-level program statements into Assembly Level Language, making it an interpreted language.

- **Distributed:**
  Java lets us create distributed applications that can run on multiple computers simultaneously.

- **Dynamic:**
  Java is designed to adapt to ever-evolving systems, making it dynamic.

- **Multi-thread:**
  Multi-threading is an important feature provided by Java for creating web applications.

- **High-performance:**
  Java uses Just-In-Time compiler, giving us high performance.

### Hello, Java!

```java
public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
  }
}
```

Output: 
```output 
Hello, Java!
```
