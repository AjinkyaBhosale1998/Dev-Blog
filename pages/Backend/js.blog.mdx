## JavaScript

Imagine a website as a house. HTML is like the bricks and walls that give it structure. CSS is like the paint and decorations that make it look nice. But without JavaScript, the house won't have any lights or running water—nothing would work or move.

JavaScript is what makes a website interactive. It's like adding electricity to the house. It lets you click buttons to open doors, turn on lights, or even play music. So, without JavaScript, a website would be like a house where nothing really happens—you could look at it. The video below shows a modal which is created using JavaScript

JavaScript is used for frontend programming, but it is also used for backend programming using Node.js. Let's take a step back and understand all these concepts one by one.

## What is Programming?

Programming is a way to talk to computers. A language like Hindi, English, or Bengali can be used to talk to a human, but for computers, we need straightforward instructions. It is the act of constructing a program, a set of precise instructions telling a computer what to do. It involves designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer programs.

## What is ECMAScript?

ECMAScript is a standard on which JavaScript is based! It was created to ensure that different documents on JavaScript are talking about the same language.

### ECMAScript Versions:

- ECMAScript 1 (ES1) was first released in 1997.
- ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) was released in 2015 and is a major revision to JavaScript.
- The latest version of JavaScript will be ECMAScript 2022 (ES13) in 2022.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a lightweight, object-oriented programming language. It is a scripting language for web pages, used to add interactivity and dynamic effects. The extension for JavaScript files is ".js". Nowadays, it is also used in server-side development.

### JS Frontend Frameworks:

- React
- Angular
- Vue

### JS Backend Frameworks:

- Express
- Node


## JavaScript Magic

JavaScript is a powerful programming language that runs in the browser and allows you to add interactivity to your websites. Here's a simple JavaScript code snippet to illustrate:

See Image Below:

![ JavaScript](./imgbackend/js.jpg)

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to the world of JavaScript.`;
}

console.log(greet('Ajinkya'));
```

Output: 
```js 
Hello, Ajinkya! Welcome to the world of JavaScript.
```
